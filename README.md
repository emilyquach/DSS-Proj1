* A lot of my experience has been focues around BridgeUSA. BridgeUSA is an organization on college campuses that brings together everyone from across the political spectrum to talk productively and empathetically.

I have also had experience with social media marketing and some web design but I am not nearly as good at those two.

He also loves long walks on the beach and Pina Coladas.
