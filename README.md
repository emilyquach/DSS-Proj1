###### Wii Fit Trainer
* I am currently a professional fighter in the roster of Super Smash Bros Ultimate as well as a casual fitness trainer. As a fighter, I have successfully turned my low tier self from SSB4 into a viable fighter in the meta. I am flexible, powerful, and determined to continue tightening my glutes. I believe that people need to take care of their health, and I am the right person to help them. In my Wii Fit position, I have successfully sold 22.67 million copies of my fitness training practices.
* Jobs interested in: Professional Lifestyle Vlogger, Personal Trainer, Top Tier Fighter

###### [Ross Irwin]
* A lot of my experience has been focues around BridgeUSA. BridgeUSA is an organization on college campuses that brings together everyone from across the political spectrum to talk productively and empathetically. I began working for the organization when I helped start the chapter at Berkeley my freshman year. Now I work on the national org and have relinquished control over the Berkeley chapter. I have also had experience with social media marketing and some web design but I am not nearly as good at those two.
* Jobs interested in: Entry Level Consultant, Future500 Analyst Position, Non-profit Development.

###### [Pikachu]
* I am an electric mouse type Pokemon looking for a new trainer to help me be the best there ever was. My previous trainer, Ash Ketchum was great, but I’m ready to expand my horizons. I’m looking for someone new to help me be the very best there ever was. (I’m getting close–you can tell because I was voiced by Ryan Reynolds.) I’ve been the very successful mascot of a popular franchise, Pokemon, since it’s inception. The Pokemon franchise has generated over 70 billion dollars in revenue. My favorite pastimes are: eating ketchup, training with my friends, and long walks on the beach.
* Jobs interested in: Model, Voice Actor, Pop Star
